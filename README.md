## About Me

I'm a Computer Science junior with a **3.54 GPA** who started college planning to play basketball but fell in love with building software instead. Now I channel that same drive and discipline into building full-stack applications that solve real-world problems.

- Founder & full-stack developer of **[Eunoia](https://eunoia-frontend-new.vercel.app/)** — a mental wellness platform with 100+ users
- Actively seeking **Summer 2026 Software Engineering Internships**
- Currently studying: AI/ML
- Passionate about: Mental health tech, AI-powered applications, and software
- Fun fact: I almost played college ball before realizing I could code instead
